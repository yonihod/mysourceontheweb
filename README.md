My Place On the Web

---

**Welcome to my small place on the web**

## Introduction

This is the official open source repository of my website/resume. It is build on the latest technologies, trying to put together as much of what I have learnt over the years into practice.

The website features a variety of tidbits from across the web, from how the server is set up to the animations on the page. This README.md serves as a feature list as to what all has made this website special, and a proof of source for anyone else to fork and work on their own version of the website (with due credits, of course).

## About the Project

**My Place On the Web** has been a project that I have been developing for quite some time.

I didn't want my information to be displayed on statics paper in HR's offices, I wanted it to be accessible for everyone.

I constantly update it with new stuff I learn, this current iteration uses GatsbyJs (React), graphQL, TailWind CSS and Firebase as a host 

If you would like to peek around the source code it can be found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/yonihod/mysourceontheweb).
